# Learning from the other person related to the assignment and their style of working Meals app

We reviewed each others apps, and code. We had some differences and similarities. I followed the react native udemy course, whereas others in my group did not.

I did not add much extra functionality outside of the assignment 2 requirements. Some nice features that the others added that i wouldve added myself are: listing the filters on each meal (if it is vegan, gluten-free, etc). More pictures for each meal, and a warning if you have favorited a meal that contains one of the filters that are active.
