# Learning from the other person related to the assignment and their style of working

We looked at and discussed eachothers code and learned from eachothers way of implementing the different features. We did some stuff different from eachother, for instance, we used different charts. I used text input for date (because this is what he did in the reactNative tutorial), but having a datepicker is definitely more intuitive, userfriendly and protects against 'wrong' user inputs.

Moving inline styles to the stylesheet can slighty improve performance. Since the app i kinda small, i could have had my navigation inside my App.js
