# Specifications

Develop an expense tracker app that allows the user to register their expenses which could be among four different categories: Food, Leisure, Travel and Work.

- In the first screen of the app, User will enter in a text box the title of the expense. The heading of this text box is “Title”. Examples of Title could be Daily Groceries or Trip to Milan.
- Just below the Title text box, the user will enter the amount of the expense. It should have a dollar icon or NOK kr icon followed by a text box.
- On the right side of the amount text box, there should be a calendar icon with dates, dates will be chosen by the user.
- Below the amount text box, there should be a drop down menu with 4 options to choose from: Food, Travel, Leisure and Work. By default food should be chosen.
- On the right hand side of the drop down menu, there should be two buttons. The names of the buttons are “Save” and “Cancel”. The function of the two buttons is saving and cancelling the expense.
- Once the user enters the Save button, she/he is taken to a new page. This page will show a bar graph corresponding to four types of expenses and how much the user spent.
- Also expenses are shown in a list form.
- On the list of expenses, when the user slides left, it deletes the expense. After performing the delete action, on the bottom of the screen one message is shown called “expense deleted” and a button is shown titled “Undo”. When a user clicks the Undo button, the deleted expense is restored. The undo button is only available for 5 seconds.
- On the list of expenses page, on the top right corner, there should be an add button with “+” icon which when clicked opens the first screen to add a new expense.
- For some seconds there is an option to undo the delete operation.
- This app is developed in the Udemy course literature and you can find the code. But code along and develop a better understanding.
- Add one additional feature in the App which you can think apart from the features developed. The additional feature should not be simple like changing colour or adding hello world page but something functional and useful.
- Submit the documentation which describes App architecture. User stories, specifications and file and folder structure.
- Well commented files describing the function of files and functions.
